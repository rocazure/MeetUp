# Rochester Azure Users Group
We are a community of people in the Rochester, NY area interested in learning more about the Azure cloud platform. 
We exists to:

- Provide a community to network with fellow local Azure colleagues
    - Demystify cloud computing concepts, patterns and provide guidance on ideal cloud workloads with lessons learned and best practices
- Stay current through Keynote discussions, Azure updates, demos and hands on labs

Our meetings are organized via [MeetUp.com](http://www.rocazure.com).

## Making your apps more personal with a chatbot
October 17, 2018 ([Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/Rochester-Azure-Users-Group/events/253621404/))

#### [Presentation](./2018-10%20Chatbots/)

Your local Microsoft cloud architect team led a discussion on the Microsoft Bot Framework to build a chatbot.

Learn how to leverage conversations to create people centric applications and extend them with Cognitive Service APIs to built in intelligence such as language processing, spell checking and image recognition.

Overview of bots then dive into code and show you how to leverage the Azure Bot Service to publish your Bot to the world.

## Demystifying Big Data technologies and solutions for the Cloud
May 16, 2018 ([Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/Rochester-Azure-Users-Group/events/248729549/))

#### [Presentation](./2018-05%20Demystifying%20Big%20Data/)

This keynote will help you level set and demystify concepts like:
- what is big data, and what new business outcomes does it enable
- what technologies and tools are available, and how to choose which one to use when
- review common big data architecture solutions, and discuss pros/cons of each
- share some real world customer examples

At the end of this session you should have a much better understanding of questions like:
- should I still use SQL
- should I use Data Lake
- do I still need a cube
- what about Hadoop/NoSQL
- what about MPP
- what is a lambda architecture

This is a must for anyone working on data centric solutions and migrating workloads to the cloud!

## Demystifying Serverless Computing
March 14, 2018 ([Meetup Link](https://www.meetup.com/Rochester-Azure-Users-Group/events/247709701/))

#### [Presentation](./2018-04%20Demystifying%20Serverless%20Computing/)
A focus on Serverless computing and Azure's comprehensive portfolio of serverless computing services.

Serverless computing lets you build and deploy great applications without having to manage servers, VM or even containers. It is event driven and resources are allocated as soon as they're triggered by an event. You're only charged for the time and resources it takes to execute your code - through per second billing.

The keynote this month will take a closer look at the Azure serverless application platform to help you boost developer productivity, create seamless connections and develop intelligent apps.
